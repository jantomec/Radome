# Radome
This repository includes AceFEM and AceGEN code I used in my final thesis when analysing inflatable radome.

Code includes elements' code for:
* gap element (element forcing certain gap between two shell elements)
* pressure element (element for applying pressure load on a shell element)
* shell element (element for mechanical shell analysis allowing large displacements)
* tangent boundary condition element (implementing non-stationary rotational support)

Radome that was analysed:
